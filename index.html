      <article>
        <p id="intro">
          🚀 Ready to embark on a journey through the magical land of
          JavaScript? Let's dive into the fascinating world of ES6, where coding
          becomes an art and scripting feels like painting with digital brushes!
        </p>

        <header>Unleashing the Power of JavaScript</header>
        <article>
          <p>
            Welcome to the dynamic realm of JavaScript, a cross-platform
            scripting language that's as lightweight as a feather but packs a
            punch like a superhero! Picture JavaScript as the maestro
            orchestrating a symphony, connecting with objects in its environment
            (think web browser) to wield control with a magical wand of code.
          </p>
          <p>
            JavaScript flaunts a treasure trove of objects like Array, Date, and
            Math, plus a bunch of language elements -operators, control
            structures, and statements. But wait, there's more! You can
            supercharge JavaScript by extending it with extra objects:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Client-side JavaScript:</strong> Imagine controlling a
              browser and its Document Object Model (DOM) like a puppet master.
              You can place elements on an HTML form, make them dance to user
              events (clicks, input, navigation), and create a web experience
              that's as interactive as a carnival!
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Server-side JavaScript:</strong> Now, imagine running
              JavaScript on a server, equipped with objects for talking to
              databases, ensuring continuity between invocations, and performing
              server-side sorcery like file manipulations. It's like having a
              coding wizard behind the scenes!

            Before we embark on this coding escapade, make sure you've got some
            basics covered:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>A sense of the Internet and the World Wide Web (WWW).</li>
            <li>
              Good knowledge of HyperText Markup Language (HTML) -our canvas for
              web art.
            </li>
            <li>
              Some programming experience. If you're new to the coding realm,
              don't worry! There are friendly tutorials waiting for you on the
              main JavaScript page.

        <header>JavaScript and Java: Siblings, but Not Twins</header>
        <article>
          <p>
            JavaScript and Java may seem like siblings, but they're different
            breeds of programming beasts. JavaScript shares some syntax and
            conventions with Java but throws in a twist -it's not bound by
            static typing and strong type checking. It's like the rebellious
            younger sibling who borrowed the cool clothes but added a personal
            touch!
          </p>
          <p>
            Unlike Java's rigid class system, JavaScript flaunts a
            prototype-based object model, dancing to its dynamic inheritance
            tune. It's a free-form language -no need to declare everything, no
            worries about public, private, or protected. Just let the creativity
            flow!

            Let's cast our first spell! Open the Scratchpad, and let the code
            enchantment begin:
          </p>
          <code
            >function greetMe(yourName){ alert("Hello " + yourName); }
          </code>
          <code> greetMe("World"); </code>
          <p>
            Select the magic runes in the pad and hit Ctrl+R to watch the
            enchantment unfold in your browser! Say hello to the digital world!
          </p>

      <section class="main-section" id="Variables:_Naming_Magic_Wands">
        <header>Variables: Naming Magic Wands</header>
        <article>
          <p>
            In JavaScript, variables are your magic wands, allowing you to give
            names to values. Identifiers, the names of your wands, have rules
            -start with a letter, underscore, or dollar sign, and dance with
            alphanumeric characters.
          </p>
          <p>Declare with var</p>
          <code> var x = 42; </code>
          <p>Simply assign (not recommended for global variables)</p>
          <code>x = 42;</code>
          <p>Declare with let (recommended for block scope)</p>
          <code>let y = 13; </code>
          <p>
            Variable scope adds a twist to the magic. Global variables are like
            spells accessible to any code in the document, while local variables
            are enchantments confined within a function. Beware, though
            -JavaScript before ECMAScript 2015 has its quirks. Let's keep the
            magic flowing!

      <section class="main-section" id="Constants:_Spells_Carved_in_Stone">
        <header>Constants: Spells Carved in Stone</header>
        <article>
          <p>
            Enter the realm of constants, where magic spells are carved in stone
            with the const keyword. A constant is a read-only, named gem with a
            personality -initialized and unchangeable while the script is in
            action.
          </p>
          <code>const PI = 3.14;</code>
          <p>
            Scope rules for constants are akin to let block scope variables.
            Beware of using a constant name already claimed by a function or
            variable in the same magical circle!

      <section class="main-section" id="Data_Types:_Magical_Essence_of_Spells">
        <header>Data Types: Magical Essence of Spells</header>
        <article>
          <p>
            The magical world of JavaScript revolves around seven data types,
            where six are primitives:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Boolean:</strong> True or false.</li>
            <li><strong>null:</strong> A special keyword denoting null.</li>
            <li>
              <strong>undefined:</strong> A top-level property representing
              undefined.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Number:</strong> Numeric wonders like 42 or 3.14159.
            </li>
            <li><strong>String:</strong> "Howdy"</li>
            <li>
              <strong>Symbol:</strong> A unique and immutable data type
              (introduced in ECMAScript 2015).
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            But wait, there's one more -the enchanting Object! Objects and
            functions are the wizards and sorcerers of JavaScript, adding depth
            and power to your coding incantations.
          </p>

        <article>
          <p>
            Time to weave conditional spells with the if...else statement! Craft
            logical conditions, and let the magic unfold:
          </p>
          <code>if (condition) { spell_1; } else { spell_2; }</code>
          <p>
            Add a dash of complexity with else if for multiple conditions.
            Remember, only the first true condition gets the spotlight. Group
            your spells with block statements for magical clarity!
          </p>

      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="Looping_Magical_Chants">
        <header>Looping Magical Chants</header>
        <article>
          <p>
            Enter the loop of enchantment with the while statement! As long as a
            condition holds true, keep chanting your magical incantations:
          </p>
          <code>while (condition) { magical_chant; }</code>
          <p>
            The loop dances to the rhythm of the condition, executing magical
            chants until the condition bids farewell. Use block statements to
            unite multiple chants!
          </p>

        <article>
          <p>
            Behold, the function declarations -your potion-brewing moments in
            JavaScript! Stir the cauldron with the function keyword, a dash of
            name, a sprinkle of arguments, and the magical statements:
          </p>
          <code>function magicalPotion(ingredients) {</code>
          <p>// Magical statements here</p>
          <code>return enchantedResult; }</code>
          <p>
            Arguments are like magical ingredients, passed by value. Stir your
            potion well, and the return statement reveals the enchanted result.
            Let the functions be your magical procedures, adding depth to your
            coding concoctions!
          </p>
          <p>
            That's just the tip of the JavaScript iceberg! Keep exploring,
            experimenting, and uncovering the magic hidden in the code scrolls.
